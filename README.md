# Car_Price_Prediction
Car Price Advisor is a university project that uses machine learning to predict used car prices based on features like brand, year, mileage and engine size. A lightweight GenAI assistant is included to explain model predictions in plain language and help users explore “what-if” scenarios when buying or selling a car.
